# Campaign Code - Rahul Rao

## Code that wins

Welcome to my repository of tools that I have created during my time working on campaigns. They were most certainly useful to me and I hope they are to you as well.

You may feel free to reference all public repositories, some of which are highlighted below! All repositories should have README files to help you along the way. If you wish to make any changes, feel free to open a pull request!

You are free to use any public code for your campaigns, on the condition that you publicly provide an attribution to the repository here. There may be other data restrictions on individual repositories so please be mindful. Note that there are many more repositories that are private. To inquire about them, [send me an email!](mailto:rahulrao@email.com)
